# Linear Algebra
This project is an introduction to linear algebra and its concepts. Linear algebra is essential to computer graphics and will give me a better understanding of what’s going on under the hood of game and graphics engines.

## Quiz questions

**Solution**  
x² = a² + b²  
x² = 64² + 121²  
x² = 4,096 + 14,641  
x² = 18,737  
x² = √18,737  
**x² = 136.88**  

**1. Magnitude #0 - 2D**  
What is the length of vector v, assuming its origin is 0, 0?

**v** = (3, 9)  
<img src="https://github.com/AlisonQuinter17/holbertonschool-csharp/blob/main/0x09-csharp-linear_algebra/images/magnitude_2D.png" class="responsive" width="400px"/>

**Solution**  
v = a² + b²  
v = 3² + 9²  
v = 9 + 81  
v = 90  
v = √90  
**v = 9.49**  

**2. Magnitude #1 - 3D**  
What is the length of v, assuming its origin is 0, 0, 0?

**v** = (7, -3, -9)  

**Solution**  
v = a² + b² + c²  
v = 7² + (-3)² + (-9)²   
v = 49 + 9 + 81  
v = 139  
v = √139  
**v = 11.79**
